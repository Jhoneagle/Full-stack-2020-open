# Full-stack-2020-open

This is repository to contain exercises made for MOOC course called [Full stack open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/). But as I have done its [previous version](https://github.com/Jhoneagle/Full-stack-2018-open) before and thus I'm only expanding the course. There will be content only for later parts.

So as a disclaimer even though most code will be written by me. There is also going to be things that I haven't made myself only copied as they have fitted the purpose of learning and passing the course.
